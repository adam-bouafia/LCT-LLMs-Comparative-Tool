## Content
This dataset contains 3.3K expert-level pairwise human preferences for model responses generated by 6 models in response to 80 MT-bench questions.
The 6 models are GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Claud-v1, Vicuna-13B, Alpaca-13B, and LLaMA-13B. The annotators are mostly graduate students with expertise in the topic areas of each of the questions. The details of data collection can be found in our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05685).

## Agreement Calculation
This Colab [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ctgygDRJhVGUJTQy8-bRZCl1WNcT8De6?usp=sharing) shows how to compute the agreement between humans and GPT-4 judge with the dataset. Our results show that humans and GPT-4 judge achieve over 80\% agreement, the same level of agreement between humans.
